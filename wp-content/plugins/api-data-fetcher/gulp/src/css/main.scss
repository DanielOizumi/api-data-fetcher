/*
  Main Styles Entry
  ----------------
  This is the main SCSS entry file that imports various SCSS modules required for the project.
  It includes global variables, responsive design mixins, color definitions, and common styles.
  Additionally, it imports any 'shame' file, which may contain quick fixes or non-ideal code.

  Note:
  - This file serves as the entry point for building your project's styles.
  - Ensure that all required styles are imported and organized appropriately.
