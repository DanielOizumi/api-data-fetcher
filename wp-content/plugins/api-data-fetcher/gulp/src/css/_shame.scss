/*
  Quick and Dirty Stylesheet
  --------------------------
  This stylesheet serves as a dedicated space for writing code that may not adhere to
  the highest coding standards but is necessary to meet project deadlines. It's the
  code that gets the release out on time but might make you a bit ashamed.

  Use this area sparingly and consider refactoring or cleaning up code when possible.

  "Quick and dirty" solutions are sometimes essential in the world of development.
